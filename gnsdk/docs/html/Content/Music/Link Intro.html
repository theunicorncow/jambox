        <h1>About Link</h1>
        <p>Link allows applications to access and present enriched content related to media that has been identified using <span class="GNVariablesProductName">GNSDK</span> identification features. Link delivers third-party content identifiers matched to the identified media, which can then be used to retrieve enriched content from Gracenote. Link can also return any custom information that a customer has linked to Gracenote data – such as their own media identifiers.<br /></p>
        <p>Without Link, developers themselves must match and integrate data from various sources to present a targeted, relevant content experience to end-users during music playback. By providing developers with the ability to retrieve enriched content, Gracenote enables its customers to generate new revenue streams while improving the music listening experience.</p>
        <p>The following is a high-level summary of the APIs that fulfill the services for Link.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Set input using result GDO; content retrieved is based on results specified in a GDO returned from previous queries</li>
            <li value="2">Retrieve enriched content; multiple pieces of content may be requested without having to set the GDO each time</li>
            <li value="3">Retrieve third-party content IDs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Available enriched content offered through Gracenote Link includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Music Enrichment
            <ul><li value="1">Album cover art</li><li value="2">Artist images</li><li value="3">Album reviews</li><li value="4">Artist biographies</li></ul></li>
            <li value="2">Third-party IDs of preferred partners</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Music Enrichment</h2>
        <p>Link provides access to Gracenote Music Enrichment – a single-source solution for enriched content including cover art, artist images, biographies, and reviews. Link and Music Enrichment allow applications to offer enriched user experiences by providing high quality images and information to complement media.<br />Gracenote provides a large library of enriched content and is the only provider of fully licensed cover art including a growing selection of international cover art. Music Enrichment cover art and artist images are provided by high quality sources that include all the major record labels.</p>
        <h2>Third-Party Identifiers and Preferred Partners</h2>
        <p>Link can also match identified media with third-party identifiers. This allows applications to match media to IDs in stores and other online services – facilitating transactions by helping connect queries directly to commerce.<br />Gracenote has preferred partnerships with several partners and matches preferred partner content IDs to Gracenote media IDs. Entitled applications can retrieve IDs for preferred partners through Link.</p>
