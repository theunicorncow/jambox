        <h1>Best Practices for Audio Stream Recognition</h1>
        <p>The following practices are recommended when recognizing audio from the microphone:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Provide clear and concise onscreen instructions on how to record the audio:<ul><li value="1">Most failed recognitions are due to incorrect operation by the user. Provide clear and concise instructions to help the user correctly operate the application to result in a higher match rate and a better user experience.</li></ul></li>
            <li value="2">While recording audio from the microphone display a progress indicator:<ul><li value="1">When recording from the microphone, the application can receive status updates. The status updates indicate what percentage of the recording is completed. Use this information to display a progress bar (indicator) to notify the user. When recording has finished use vibration or a tone (or both) to notify the user.</li></ul></li>
            <li value="3">Visual only notifications can hamper the user experience because:<ul><li value="1">The user may not see notifications if they are holding the recording device up to an audio source. Also, the user may pull the device away from an audio source to check if recording has completed. This may result in a poor quality recording.<br />In general, your application should display an animation to indicate the application is performing an operation. If the application appears to stop, the user may believe the application has crashed.</li></ul></li>
            <li value="4">If no match is found, redisplay the user instructions and ask the user to try again.</li>
        </ul>
